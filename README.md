## Current Research

### [The Holographic Language Framework](https://github.com/dparksports/Holographic-Language-for-AI)

Engineering a mathematically rigorous alternative to brute-force context scaling in Large Language Models.

The core thesis: probabilistic natural-language tokens are geometrically hostile to exact logical reasoning at scale. The softmax partition function inflates logarithmically with sequence length, and the Welch Bound guarantees that millions of semantic vectors packed into ~12K dimensions will bleed into each other — a problem I call **Adversarial Polysemy**.

The framework replaces this with:

- **Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA)** — O(d) algebraic bind/unbind in complex frequency space via FHRR
- **Orthogonal Embedding Surgery** — Gram-Schmidt isolation of logic primitives from semantic noise
- **Continuous Hopfield Cleanup** — Error-correcting attractor network that snaps drifting vectors to pristine anchors
- **Deterministic Logit Masking** — AST-constrained token selection via Context-Free Grammar enforcement

### Key Metrics

| | Standard English Tokens | Orthogonal Logic Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| **Participation Ratio** | 94.34 (diffuse/overlapping) | 31.93 (point-mass) |
| **1,000-step Hopfield Cleanup** | ~0.04 cosine drift | >0.999 cosine fidelity |
| **Binding Complexity** | O(N·d) attention | O(d) element-wise |
