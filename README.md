### 🚀 Core Projects

* **[SystemMonitor](https://github.com/dparksports/SystemMonitor)**: A native Windows C# agent for autonomous system health. It monitors telemetry and uses Gemini Pro to diagnose and execute self-healing protocols locally.
* **[SecureFileMonitor](https://github.com/dparksports/SecureFileMonitor)**: A high-performance Windows security observer. It provides real-time file integrity monitoring and uses LLM-driven classification to identify and quarantine threats.

### 🛠 Technical Background
