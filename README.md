> 🔭 **Current Focus:** Solving "Regression Hell" and the "Foggy Boundary" in Large Language Models via Direct Latent Space Mapping.

I am an AI Research Engineer and the author of the **Spatial Constraint Protocol (SCP)**. [cite_start]My work challenges the industry's "Context Wars" by identifying the **Billion Token Fallacy**: the erroneous assumption that expanding token windows equates to qualitative reasoning improvements[cite: 8, 9].

[cite_start]My research demonstrates that high-dimensional engineering contexts inevitably hit a "Foggy Boundary"—a thermodynamic threshold where the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the Transformer attention mechanism degrades due to entropy[cite: 9].

### The Problem: Regression Hell
[cite_start]In high-stakes engineering environments, standard LLMs suffer from **Regression Hell**, where the energy required to verify AI-generated code exceeds the energy required to write features ($E_{verify} \gg E_{feature}$), reducing velocity to zero[cite: 57, 59, 60].

### The Solution: Direct Latent Space Mapping
[cite_start]SCP is a neuro-symbolic architecture that replaces probabilistic tokenization with **Uiua** bijective primitives ($f: \mathcal{L} \rightarrow V_L$)[cite: 10, 73]. By mapping logic directly to the model's latent space, we achieve:
* [cite_start]**Fractal Independence:** Global stability achieved via local coherence, driving emergent coupling terms to zero [cite: 114-118].
* [cite_start]**Zero Semantic Distortion:** Information-theoretic completeness proved via Semantic Rate-Distortion Theory[cite: 103, 104].
* [cite_start]**The Weaver:** A monitoring function that detects undeclared coupling as an immune response[cite: 133, 136].

### Empirical Results (Native Windows/CUDA Case Study)
| Metric | Baseline (Standard GPT-4) | SCP Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context** | 128k tokens (saturated) | 1,200 atomic vectors (106x compression) |
| **Regression Rate** | 14.3% per commit | **<0.1% per commit** |
| **Feature Velocity** | 0% (Stalled) | **100% (Restored)** |
| **Semantic Entropy** | Foggy ($H(S) > C_a$) | Clear ($H(S) < C_a$) |

## 🛠 Project Chevron
**Status:** *Active Development*

**Project Chevron** is the reference implementation of SCP. [cite_start]It is designed to validate the scalability of Uiua-based latent space programming in production engineering environments[cite: 151, 170].

* [cite_start]**Core:** Native Windows (C#), CUDA, Python[cite: 138].
* [cite_start]**Interface:** Uiua (Stack-based array language with rank polymorphism)[cite: 83, 88].
* [cite_start]**Goal:** To serve as the first working instance of Uiua-based latent space programming[cite: 170].
