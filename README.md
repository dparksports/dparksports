# 🚀 Magic Point | Autonomous AI Reliability & Security

**Building the future of self-healing infrastructure.** At MagicPoint, we develop **Agentic AI Sentinels** that move beyond observability into autonomous action. Our agents don't just alert you to problems—they diagnose and fix them in real-time.

### 🧠 The Technology: Agentic AI Loop

We utilize a hybrid approach to infrastructure security:
1.  **Local Ingestion:** Agents monitor telemetry at the edge for maximum security and speed.
2.  **AI Reasoning:** We leverage **Google Gemini** on **Vertex AI** to analyze complex failure modes that traditional rules miss.
3.  **Automated Remediation:** The system autonomously selects and validates the best repair path, closing the loop without human intervention.
